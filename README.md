The following project is active research on randomizing the The density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm also known as the approximate linerized scheme (ALS) or modfied approximate linearized scheme (MALS) 

Input data is a randomly generate Hamiltonian Heisenberg matrix with dimensions 2^n x 2^n formed in tensor train format. 

Randomization is included throughout the original algorithm with observable improvements over conventional qr decomposition approaches to right to left orthogonalization of tensor cores. 


Additional work includes an unoptimized implementation of  the sketched rayleigh-ritz form the following paper:
