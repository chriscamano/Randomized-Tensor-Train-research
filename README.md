# Randomized-Tensor-Train-research

The following project is active research on randomizing the The density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm also known as the approximate linerized scheme (ALS) or modfied approximate linearized scheme (MALS) 

Input data is a randomly generate Hamiltonian Heisenberg matrix with dimensions 2^n x 2^n formed in tensor train format. 

Randomization is included throughout the original algorithm with observable improvements over conventional qr decomposition approaches to right to left orthogonalization of tensor cores.
